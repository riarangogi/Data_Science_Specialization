## Executive Summary

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG.

- Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

## Load Data

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). It consists of 32 observations on 11 variables.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
names(mtcars)
```

## Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?

For automatic:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
summary(mtcars[mtcars$am==0,])
```



For manual:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
summary(mtcars[mtcars$am==1,])
```

Hence, the mean of mpg is greater for manual (at 24.4) than automatic (at 17.1).

Investigating further..

## Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
boxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, xlab = "Transmission", ylab = "Miles per gallon", main="Miles per gallon by Transmission Type")
```

Manual (represented by 1) has a higher mean for mpg than automatic (represented by 0).

## Hypothesis Testing

```{r,echo=TRUE}
aggregate(mpg~am, data = mtcars, mean)
```

The mean transmission for manual is 7.24mpg higher than automatic. Let alpha=0.5.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
auto <- mtcars[mtcars$am == 0,]
manual <- mtcars[mtcars$am == 1,]
t.test(auto$mpg, manual$mpg)
```

Since p-value = 0.001374, we reject the null hypothesis. There is a major difference between mpg of manual and automatic transmissions.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
m<-lm(mpg~am,data=mtcars)
summary(m)
```

From the above, we may conclude that automatic run at 17.15mpg, while manual have 7.24 more mpg.

Also, R^2 is 0.36, hence the model only accounts for 36% variance.

Performing multivariate linear regression:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
model <- lm(mpg~am + wt + hp + cyl, data = mtcars)
anova(m,model)
```

The final model is below:
```{r,echo=TRUE}
summary(model)
```

## Conclusion

This model explains 84.9% of the variance. It may be concluded that on average, manual transmissions have 1.478 more mpg than automatic.

## APPENDIX

```{r,echo=TRUE}
plot(model)
```

Hence, the residuals are normally distributed, and homoskedastic.
