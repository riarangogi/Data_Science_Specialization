Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!


## MAP

```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=6.2002379, lng= -75.5725278, popup="My Office")
my_map
```
